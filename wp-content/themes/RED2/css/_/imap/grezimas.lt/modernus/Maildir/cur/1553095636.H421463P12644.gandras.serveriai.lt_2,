Dear Beneficiary,

My name is Lara Bendinelli of the World Economic Forum.
At the end of the World Economic Forum  Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters  on 22-25 January 2019 which convened world leaders to discuss the global, regional and industry agendas at the beginning of each year. The World Economic Forum's mission is to improve the state of the world, which has driven the design and development of the Annual Meeting objectives. The forum hosted over 3,000 delegates representing 114 Countries,
It was agreed among other things and in agreement with the IMF that making growth sustainable, making growth inclusive and harnessing technology for good  is a priority and must be tackled without delay.

Therefore the World Economic Forum initiated an electronic random pick and through this electronic random pick, your name and email was chosen for  the implementation of making sustainable growth and harnessing technology for good.
Funds has been mapped out for those randomly picked.
This disbursement will be monitored by the Newedge Financial Group (NFG). You are therefore advised to contact the NFG Commissioner who will monitor the disbursement of the funds mapped out for you.

NAME: Mr. Abelard Brice GAUTIER,
EMAIL: abgautier-nfg@newedgegroup.org
