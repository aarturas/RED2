Dear good friend,

How are you today and your family? I hope all are in good condition. I am Mr. Les Matheson, working as the Chief Executive, Personal & Business Banking of Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) here in London, England United Kingdom. I am writing you about a business proposal that will be of immense and mutual benefit for both of us.

It might interest you to know that in my department as head of the audit department, I discovered an abandoned sum of 16, 500,000.00 (Sixteen million five hundred thousand British pounds sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our late foreign customer Mrs. Surti Dahlia. Our bank has failed in the search for her next of kin or closest relative.

I seek your consent to present you to our bank as the closest relatives of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 16.5 million GBP can be paid to you. This deal will be distributed in the following proportion: 55% to me and 45% for you. Please on your confirmation of this message and indicating your interest, I will furnish you with more information.

Endeavour to let me know your decision rather than keeping me waiting.

Thanking you in anticipation for your favourable and positive reply.

Regards

Mr. Les Matheson
Chief Executive, Personal & Business Banking
Royal Bank of Scotland
