Greetings,
 URGENT APPEAL: Across the country, over 10 million hectares of Australian =
land has been burned to the ground. Over 1 billion animals have lost their =
lives so far, including thousands of koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, birds an=
d other iconic wildlife. Your support is urgently needed to care for injure=
d wildlife and restore their homes. =

  Right now, Australia is being ravaged by one of the most devastating bush=
fire seasons the country has ever seen.
 So far, more than 10 million hectares of Australian land has been burned.
 It=2019s estimated that as many as 8,400 koalas have perished in fires on =
the mid-north coast of NSW and Kangaroo Island in South Australia has lost =
over 50% of their koala population This is a devastating blow for an iconic=
 species already in decline, and these bushfires have the potential to hast=
en koalas=2019 slide towards extinction in eastern Australia.
 Koalas could be extinct in the wild in eastern Australia in as little as 3=
0 years due mainly to ongoing excessive tree-clearing for agricultural and =
urban development and climate heating triggered bushfires that destroy koal=
a habitat, that potentially accelerate the extinction timeline.
 But all hope is not lost. Help is urgently needed for the national emergen=
cy fund to help raise $30 million to deliver:
 =2022 Wildlife response - including partnering with wildlife response orga=
nisations, communities and scientists nationally for a swift and effective =
response and recovery at scale.
=2022 Habitat restoration - including restoring native forests and damaged =
wildlife habitat, stopping deforestation, cultivating habitat connectivity,=
 core habitat and Indigenous and rural fire management.
=2022 Future proofing Australia - including driving innovative solutions to=
 help mitigate climate change, driving climate event preparedness, species =
adaptation and long-term wildlife and nature conservation efforts towards s=
ecuring Australia=2019s natural resources for people and nature.
  =

 Can you help save our precious koalas before they're gone forever? =

Pleas contact us with our email below to make your donation and help what i=
s lost : charity@australiamail.com
 Regards,
Australian Charity
