Hello Dear,
Greeting To You! I know that this mail might be a surprise to you. But
please bring your attention to read this message with sympathetic
mind. My name is Dani SERGE the only child of ( Mr. KOFFI SERGE) from
Republic of Cote d'Ivoire. My father was the formal Minister of
Importation and Exportation of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. It's
very sad to say that my father was among the Ministers killed by the
agents of the former government of President Laurent Gbagbo during the
political crisis / war because of his support and sympathy for
opposition party (Rassemblement Des R=C3=A9publicains) de C=C3=B4tes d'Ivoi=
re
(RDR). While my mother died after my birth and since then, My father
has been the only person to have participated in my life. He was a
good father and he took me so special. I'm still younger and tender
age and I really do not know what to do. This is because I have
suffered a lot of set backs as a result of political crisis in my
country.
However, I would like to know more about you and discuss investment
issue with you because before the death of my father, he called me
secretly on his hospital bed where he was admitted, and told me that
he has a fixed deposit account of the sum of $5.5 Million (Five
Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollar) which he deposited
in the investments bank with my name as the next of kin. Presently,
this fund is still intact with the bank and the last time I
communicate with the bank director, he informed me of the maturity
date of my late father's fixed deposit, the bank director advise me to
issue an authorisation to somebody to receive this fund on my behalf
since I'm still young and tender age, or otherwise, they get the fund
confiscated.
So please I'm in a sincere desire of your humble assistant both for
the transfer of this money to your bank account for an investments and
to bring me into your country to continue my education. This is my
reason for contacting you. Because after the death and burial of my
father, his wicked brothers (My Wicked Uncles) sold all my father's
properties and share the money among themselves living nothing for my
future and education. They also planned to kill me in other for them
to have access to claim this money my late father deposited in the
bank, so I ran away with the deposit certificate document of the fund
for the safety and future of my life. Now I'm living in one of the
Church Mission without a father, mother or guardians at my tender age.
Many thanks if you can be able to assist or help me to solve this
problem I found myself, I would be happy to compensate you with 30%
after you have helped me transfer this money successfully into your
bank account. I will give you more details only if you will be
interested to assist me. Please your suggestions and ideas will be
highly appreciated.
If you are interested to assist me, kindly reply me urgently through
my private e-mail address here ((( da.2.sg2000@gmail.com ))) for more
explanations and information's.
I'm waiting for your consideration response.
Thanks and best regards.
Yours Sincerely,
Dani SERGE.
