     REF: SONANGOL OF ANGOLA
 ATTN: CEO / Managing Director,
 It is my pleasure to introduce to you this highly lucrative crude oil sale=
s venture.  I propose that we become joint partners in a crude oil sales pr=
oject under the umbrella of the Sonangol Petroleum Agency of Angola. We wou=
ld register either your company or a joint company with the local corporate=
 affairs commission of Angola and would then re-assign an already allocated=
 crude oil sales license to the company and act as representative of the Pe=
troleum agency in selling of crude oil to the end buyers.
=20=20
 I have previously assisted a company based in Wisconsin, America to secure=
 a crude oil sales license allocated in 2007. The owner of this company, Mr=
. Ken Hendricks could not actualize his dream in this project as he had an =
accident thereby becoming incapable of being active in business. I will rep=
ackage your company as the crude oil license beneficiary. We would re-assig=
n the sales license that was previously given to late Mr. Ken Henricks to y=
our company. This will give your company the authority to act as crude oil =
sales agent / representative for Sonangol  14 Sociedade Nacional de Combust=
=EDveis de Angola, E.P.
=20=20
 The assignment of the crude oil sales allocation to your company gives us =
the privilege to operate as the first lifter of the crude oil from the bloc=
k. This attracts USD$4.00 discount per barrel to the lifter. The USD$4.00 i=
s ours (lifter) entitlement from the petroleum agency. Also being able to g=
et final buyers entitles us to USD$2.00 discount from the discount given to=
 end buyers as mandate.
=20=20
 As we are going to be lifting 2 Million barrels per a month from the block=
. The USD$4.00 discount from National petroleum agency sums up to USD$8 Mil=
lion per a month, and the USD$2.00 discount from the end buyers comes to US=
D$4 Million per a month. This total to USD$12 Million gross coming to our g=
roup per a transaction in a month. On equity sharing ration, both of us wil=
l be netting a total USD$12 Million as profits monthly. These proceeds (com=
mission) will be shared equally on equity between both of us at the end of =
every sales operational month.
=20=20
 This project is highly profitable and presently the most legitimate money =
making machinery available in the oil and gas industry. What is of interest=
 about the project is that your presence is not compulsory, rather after th=
e registration of your company and obtaining the crude oil sales license, w=
e would connect buyers to the petroleum agency  with my connections at Sona=
ngol and our commission will be directed to your nominated bank co-ordinate=
s after all due dilligence. I appreciate your understanding and keen intere=
st to take advantage of this profitable opportunity.
 Best Regards,
